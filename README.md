# Arduino2560_EFI_Output_Shield
Fuel Injection shield for Arduino 2560

Output Shield feature list



Speeduino 0.3 features....

Open source SMT Design using DesignSpark PCB

4 14A Injector drivers
4 Ignition Drivers
4 Spare Low side drivers with pwm
2 Spare Low side drivers from digital out 
LED indicators for each output

Ignition Ground, Injector Ground, Spare Output Ground and Ground all routed independantly and joined via board jumpers 
If desired and highly recomended an option to merge all 4 together off board at the chassis - simplifies routing and noise performance of Design.

All outputs are wire connections to PCB (16 awg) - no common location for connections - simplifies routing and noise performance of Design
Stackable design - using the correct board connectors

Blank PCB's can be ordered from OSH PARK https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/XDy18G73 about $10 each need to buy 3 pcs
